## Quickstart (TL;DR)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit_risk_calculator.git
cd credit_risk_calculator
cp env.example .env
# Start API, MLflow, Jupyter
docker-compose up --build
# Or include monitoring
docker-compose --profile monitoring up --build
```

Once the stack is running:

| Service | URL |

| API (Swagger) | http://localhost:8001/docs |
| MLflow | http://localhost:5001 |
| JupyterLab | http://localhost:8888 |
